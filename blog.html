                        <li><span class="font-bold">Let:</span> Block-scoped. Not hoisted to the top of their scope. Can be reassigned within the same block, but not re-declared.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold">Const:</span> Block-scoped. Must be assigned a value when declared and cannot be reassigned afterward. Not hoisted to the top of their scope. Can hold objects or arrays whose content can be modified, but the variable itself cannot be reassigned.</li>

                    <p>Using let and const is generally recommended for better scoping control and to prevent unintended variable modifications.</p>

                    Tell us the use cases of null and undefined?

                  <div class="collapse-content">
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li><span class="font-bold">null: </span> Used to intentionally represent the absence of any object value or intentional non-value. It's often assigned to a variable to indicate that the variable should have no value or be uninitialized.</li>
                        <li><span class="font-bold">undefined: </span> Typically indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. It's the default value of variables that haven't been assigned a value. It's also returned by functions that don't explicitly return a value..</li>

                    <p>In summary, use null when you want to indicate intentional absence of value, and undefined when a variable hasn't been assigned a value or a function doesn't return anything explicitly.</p>

                    What do you mean by REST API?
                  </div>
                  <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a set of principles and constraints for designing and interacting with web services. REST APIs enable communication between different software applications over the internet using a standardized set of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and data formats (often JSON or XML). They allow resources to be manipulated using these methods, following a stateless client-server architecture.</p>
